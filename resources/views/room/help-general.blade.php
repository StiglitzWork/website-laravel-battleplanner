<h1 class="text-center">Welcome to the Battleplanner!</h1>
<h3>
  For starters...
</h3>
<p>
   Thank you for trying this app!
</p>
<p>
   You can load and save maps as you see fit. Everything is dynamically updated for everyone in the room instantly. Anyone connected to the room will see what the room owner sets as the current map.
   Only the room owner can change operators and edit the notes.
   As well, only the room owner can save the map and its drawings.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone can draw on the map, however it will not be saved the next time the map is loaded, all those changes will be gone unless the room owner specifically saved them. Take that griefers!
