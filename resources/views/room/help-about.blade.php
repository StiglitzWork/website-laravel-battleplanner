<h1 class="text-center">Hey there!</h1>
<h3>
  Who are we?
</h3>
<p>
  We're the Tavernside dev team! Devs, gamers, podcasters, nerds and writers! Welcome to our first large-scale project, hopefully of many! Any feedback you have can be sent to us directly by email at tavern.side.podcast@gmail.com or can be sent to us directly on Reddit! Find us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tavernsidepodcast">our subreddit</a>, we're all mods there!
</p>

<h3>
  Public Trello page!
</h3>
<p>
  Have a look at our <a href="https://trello.com/b/gItW96Md">public Trello page!</a> It's the easiest way to see what's in development, what's already included and what's planned for the future!
</p>

<h3>
  How's your servers?
</h3>
<p>
  Non-profit means low budget, unfortunately, so our server could best be described as duct tape and prayers. If you'd like to donate some money to maintain/upgrade the server, we have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tavernside">a Patreon page!</a>
